        "# IEEE-CIS Fraud Detection\n",
        "\n",
        "The IEEE-CIS Fraud Detection competition was held on Kaggle in 2019 and was sponsored by the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Computational Intelligence Society (IEEE-CIS). The dataset used for the competition was provided by a financial institution and contained transaction data for credit card usage. The goal of the competition was to build a machine learning model that could accurately detect fraudulent transactions in this highly imbalanced dataset. The competition was widely participated in by the machine learning community, and the results showed the power of modern machine learning techniques for addressing the challenge of fraud detection. The dataset and the competition continue to be a popular source of inspiration and learning for those interested in this field.\n",
        "\n",
        "In this Jupyter notebook, we explore the use of Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE) and XGBoost for classifying fraudulent transactions in the IEEE-CIS dataset. Fraud detection is a crucial task in the financial industry as it helps prevent significant losses. However, traditional methods of fraud detection can be easily fooled by the imbalanced nature of fraud data, where the number of fraud cases is usually much lower than the number of non-fraud cases.\n",
        "\n",
        "SMOTE is a popular method for handling imbalanced data by creating synthetic samples of the minority class (in this case, fraud). By oversampling the minority class, SMOTE helps balance the distribution of the target variable, making the model more robust to imbalanced data.\n",
        "\n",
        "In this project, we use a combination of SMOTE and XGBoost to address the challenge of detecting fraud in a highly imbalanced dataset. SMOTE helps to balance the distribution of the target variable by generating synthetic samples of the minority class; on the other hand, XGBoost, is a well-regarded machine learning algorithm known for its high accuracy and ability to process large datasets. By utilizing both SMOTE and XGBoost, this project aims to provide a practical demonstration of the capabilities of these techniques for fraud detection. The results of this project will serve as an introductory example of a very rich field of active research in the area of fraud detection\n",

        "Now that our datasets are loaded in, we can now take advantage of the feature they have in common: TransactionID. We will use the merge() function in Pandas to create our full dataset by combining all relavent identifying information about the purchaser with each transaction in the transactions dataset. We are told there are records in the transactions dataset for which there is no identifying information, so we will left-join as to keep all transactions. We can see below that the resulting dataset is nearly 600,000 records, each with 433 features and one response. "
